# Engine Machining
Engine Machining is a mod that aims to provide semi-realistic systems to Minecraft. It adds lots of useful machinery implemented a lot differently than in other mods.
 You will have to build multiblock creations for simple tasks, solve power delivery issues and make sure that your machines don't overheat. This mod is a lot more challenging at first but once you get used to the new concepts it's a lot of fun.
