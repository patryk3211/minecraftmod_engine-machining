# Contributing to Engine Machining
We appreciate every contribution you make.
## What can you contribute?
Anything that has to do with the mod, a feature, a bugfix, a bug report, a feature request, whatever you want!
## How do you contribute?
You can contribute by creating an issue, or a pull request. You should submit a pull request once you feel like we should implement your code into the main mod. An issue should be create when you have a question, a request, a bug report or anything else that does not directly involve code in it.

The most simple way you can contribute is by translating this mod to a different language. How do you do that?
1. Fork the repository into your GitHub account.
1. Clone it onto your computer and import into your IDE of choice.
1. Create a language file in `resources/assets/enginemachining/lang/`, the name of the file has to be a language code with the `.json` extension.
1. Translate the mod, you can look into the `en_us.json` file to see how to create language file entries.
1. Commit all the changes.
1. Submit a pull request from your forked repository into the main repository.
1. Wait for us to review your submission, if all is good we will most likely approve it.

And that's how you contribute.
